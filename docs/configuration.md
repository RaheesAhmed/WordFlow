## Environment Variables

WordFlow uses environment variables for sensitive information and global settings. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:

```
# API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_api_token_here
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key_here

# Default Settings
DEFAULT_LANGUAGE=English
DEFAULT_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
DEFAULT_IMAGE_MODEL=stability-ai/stable-diffusion
DEFAULT_COUNTRY=us

# Performance Settings
BATCH_SIZE=5
MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=20
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys and preferred default settings.

## WordPress Site Configuration

WordPress sites are configured in the `websites` dictionary in the `app.py` file. Add or modify sites using the following format:

```python
websites = {
    1: {
        "url": "https://example.com/wp-json/wp/v2/",
        "user": "your_username",
        "password": "your_password"
    },
    # Add more sites as needed
}
```

Ensure that you're using application passwords for enhanced security. To generate an application password:

1. Go to your WordPress dashboard
2. Navigate to Users â†’ Profile
3. Scroll down to the Application Passwords section
4. Enter a name for the application password and click "Add New"
5. Copy the generated password and use it in the configuration

## AI Model Settings

Configure AI model settings in the Streamlit sidebar:

- **Input Language**: Select the primary language for content generation.
- **OpenAI Model**: Choose between different OpenAI models (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4).
- **Image AI Model**: Select the AI model for image generation.

These settings can be adjusted per session in the Streamlit interface.

## Content Generation Settings

Customize content generation in the `generate_html_content` function:

- Modify the HTML structure for generated content
- Adjust the word count or structure of different sections
- Customize the prompt to fit your content style and requirements

## SEO Settings

SEO settings are managed in the `generate_seo_elements` function:

- Modify the list of generated SEO elements
- Adjust the format of meta descriptions, titles, and keywords
- Customize the prompt to align with your SEO strategy

## Image Generation Settings

Configure image generation settings in the Streamlit sidebar:

- **Number of Images**: Set the number of images to generate per post
- **Image AI Model**: Choose the AI model for image generation

Adjust the `generate_image_async` function to modify image generation parameters.

## Scheduling Options

Post scheduling options are available in the Streamlit sidebar:

- **Relative to today**: Schedule posts relative to the current date
- **Specific date**: Set an exact date and time for post publishing

Modify the `create_post_async` function to adjust how posts are scheduled and published.

## Performance Tuning

Optimize performance by adjusting the following settings:

- **BATCH_SIZE**: Number of keywords processed in each batch (in `.env` file)
- **MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS**: Maximum number of concurrent API requests (in `.env` file)
- Adjust the `asyncio.Semaphore` value in the code to control concurrency

Monitor the application's performance and adjust these values as needed based on your system's capabilities and API rate limits.
